<h3>Fraud Detection Using Self-Organizing Maps</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
This project demonstrates the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for fraud detection using credit card applications data. The Self-Organizing Map is an unsupervised learning neural network that can detect patterns in complex, high-dimensional data, making it suitable for fraud detection applications.

<h4>Data</h4>
The dataset contains credit card applications data, including various features such as income, age, credit score, and more. The goal is to train a SOM to detect patterns in the data that indicate fraudulent applications.

<h4>Model</h4>
The SOM is trained on the credit card applications data to create a map of neurons that represent different clusters of applications. Applications that are outliers or do not fit into any cluster may be flagged as potentially fraudulent.

<h4>Results</h4>
The project will analyze the performance of the SOM in detecting fraudulent applications and evaluate its effectiveness in comparison to traditional fraud detection methods.
