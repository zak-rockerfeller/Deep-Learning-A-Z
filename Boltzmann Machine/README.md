<h3>Music Artist Recommendation using Restricted Boltzmann Machine>/h3>
This project utilizes a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to recommend music artists to individual users based on their preferences and popular music records. The RBM is constructed as a Python class using PyTorch and trained on data from last.fm.

  <h4>Project Objectives</h4>
- Implement an RBM to predict music artist preferences for users.
- Use scaled inputs (0 to 1) representing the popularity of each artist for a user.
- Evaluate the model's performance using error metrics.
- Compare the performance of the RBM with traditional binary inputs.

<h4>Dataset</h4>
The dataset used is a sanitized subset of the last.fm dataset, containing scrobble counts for artists generated by users. 
The dataset includes:
'lastfm_user_scrobbles.csv': Contains scrobble counts for 17,493 artists generated by 1,892 users.
'lastfm_artist_list.csv': Contains the list of 17,493 artists referenced by a unique id code.
