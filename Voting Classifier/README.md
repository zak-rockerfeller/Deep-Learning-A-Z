<h3>Oil and Gas Reservoir Exploration</h3>

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms for hydrocarbon exploration in the oil and gas industry. The project aims to address the industry's need for innovative solutions due to the continuity and high complexity of the technological chain, from geological exploration to product delivery. By leveraging machine learning, particularly for forecasting the development of new profitable fields, this project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of locating oil and gas deposits both onshore and offshore.
