<h3>Oil and Gas Reservoir Exploration</h3>
This dataset contains information about oil and gas reservoir units, including their location, geological characteristics, and operational status. The dataset can be used for analysis and modeling to predict factors related to oil and gas exploration and production.

<h3>Data Description</h3>
The dataset includes the following fields for each reservoir unit:

游릭 Reservoir unit: Name of the reservoir unit.</n>
游릭 Country: Country where the reservoir unit is located.
游릭 Region: Region within the country where the reservoir unit is located.
游릭 Basin name: Name of the geological basin where the reservoir unit is located.
游릭 Tectonic regime: Tectonic regime of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Latitude: Latitude coordinates of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Longitude: Longitude coordinates of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Operator company: Company responsible for operating the reservoir unit.
游릭 Onshore/Offshore: Indicates whether the reservoir unit is located onshore or offshore.
游릭 Hydrocarbon type: Type of hydrocarbon found in the reservoir unit (e.g., oil, gas).
游릭 Reservoir status: Status of the reservoir unit (e.g., declining production).
游릭 Structural setting: Structural setting of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Depth: Depth of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Reservoir period: Geological period to which the reservoir unit belongs.
游릭 Lithology: Type of rock formation in the reservoir unit.
游릭 Thickness (gross average ft): Gross average thickness of the reservoir unit.
游릭 Thickness (net pay average ft): Net pay average thickness of the reservoir unit.
